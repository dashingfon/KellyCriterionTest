# Kellly Criterion Test
This repository is a test for the kelly criterion

In probability theory, the Kelly criterion (or Kelly strategy or Kelly bet), is a formula that determines the optimal theoretical size for a bet. It is valid when the expected returns are known. The Kelly bet size is found by maximizing the expected value of the logarithm of wealth, which is equivalent to maximizing the expected geometric growth rate. It was described by J. L. Kelly Jr, a researcher at Bell Labs, in 1956.[1] The criterion is also known as the scientific gambling method, as it leads to higher wealth compared to any other strategy in the long run (i.e. the theoretical maximum return as the number of bets goes to infinity).

The practical use of the formula has been demonstrated for gambling[2][3] and the same idea was used to explain diversification in investment management.

In this project, I Used the kelly criterion to determine the amount I should wager given the probability of winning and the edge in the bet, then ran it several times to determine the final balance.

Also in the test.py file, I tested the accuracy of using the randint function to get probabilities
